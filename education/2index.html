                    <p>In the resent past,this body came up with an announcement that shocked everyone<br></br>The most hitted by this most painful nail being the students <i>more so UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.</i></p>
                    <P>To be more specific, <b><i>One hundred and thirty three(133)</i></b>courses being offered in over 20 universities countrywide are <strong>fake degree courses.</strong></P>
                    <p>This is a very nasty and disguising issue in life of many students and even their poor parents who have greately invested in their children hoping that one day their kids will get a white color job after completing campus education and improve their lifestyle<br>Among the very many universities that were affected was <I>TOM MBOYA University where the largest number of courses totaling to 25, were rejected.</I></br></p>
                    <p>Due to this <i><b>over 10,000 </b></i>students were caught into this sought of shit.<br><b>wahat a shocking situation to the poor Kenyan student?</b></br></p>
                    <p>***************I know many questions have been asked both out of emotions and just the need to know why THIS, may students have been caught up int this brutal situation and many other unquesionable things have happened as a result of this problem******<strong><i>But my concern to the Kenyan government still stands,"What is the fate of this affected poor Kenyans and what plan does the government have for this messsed up and wasted time of this students?"****************</i></strong></p>
